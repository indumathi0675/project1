#  Maury 2640D Slide Screw Tuner Simulation & Modeling

📡 Overview
This project involves the 3D electromagnetic simulation and machine learning modeling of the Maury 2640D slide screw tuner, a precision impedance tuner used in RF testing environments, and load pull measurements.
:

📏 1. Physical Measurement:

The physical Maury 2640D tuner was measured manually using a Vernier Caliper to gather all critical dimensional data. These dimensions were used as input for simulation modeling.

🧪 2. HFSS Simulation

Using the collected measurements, the tuner was modeled and simulated in ANSYS HFSS (Student Version) to study its electromagnetic behavior.

🤖 3. Regression Model for Tuner Probe Prediction:

A regression model was developed to predict the probe position of the tuner based on:

Input frequency

Desired VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio)

This helps in automating tuner configuration for specific impedance matching tasks.
